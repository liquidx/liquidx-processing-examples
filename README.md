Programmatic animation examples.

The collection here is to help me learn the techniques from the best programmatic animators around and understand how they rig up their animation and put them together.

I am a big fan of programmatic animations and like to learn from others. Since most of these are not done by me, I will attribute them as best as I can. Please let me know if there are ones that are improperly attributed or if you want them to be taken down.
